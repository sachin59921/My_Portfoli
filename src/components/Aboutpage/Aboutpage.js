  <p>👋 I'm Sachin Kumar Pal, a detail-driven and enthusiastic QA Software Engineer based in Ponda, Goa. I'm currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) at Goa University and actively seeking entry-level or internship opportunities in Software Quality Assurance (QA).</p>

  <p>🛠️ I recently completed a QA internship at SJ Innovation Pvt. Ltd., where I gained hands-on experience in:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Manual testing of web applications</li>
    <li>Designing and executing detailed test cases</li>
    <li>Bug tracking and reporting using Jira</li>
    <li>Working in Agile teams, participating in daily stand-ups and sprint planning</li>
    <li>Performing regression and functional testing to ensure smooth, high-quality releases</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This experience helped me build a solid foundation in QA processes, SDLC, and team collaboration — and fueled my passion for delivering reliable and user-focused products.</p>

  <p>💻 I also bring frontend skills in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and React.js, which help me understand user interfaces from both a developer and a tester’s perspective — making my QA work more insightful and efficient.</p>

  <p>📸 Outside of tech, I enjoy photography and exploring new places, which enhance my attention to detail and creative thinking.</p>

  <p>🚀 I’m currently open to work and looking for roles such as QA Intern, Junior QA Engineer, or Manual Tester, where I can grow under mentorship and contribute to high-quality software development.</p>

  <p>📬 Let’s connect! Feel free to reach out if you’re hiring, collaborating, or want to explore how we can work together.</p>
